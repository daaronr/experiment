R package experiment Provides various statistical methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments. One functionality of the package is the implementation of randomized-block and matched-pair designs based on possibly multivariate pre-treatment covariates. The package also provides the tools to analyze various randomized experiments including cluster randomized experiments, two-stage randomized experiments, randomized experiments with noncompliance, and randomized experiments with missing data.
